## Preface
I would like to start by saying this is most definetly a project that is going to take **some time** to create.

## Where do we begin?

I going to start this what i'd like to call a **mega project**; with some definitions of course! 

## What exactly is SLAM?
SLAM (Simultaneous localization and mapping) is the Mother of all Robotics Algorithms in my opinion. This project will give me all the tools I need to:
1. Do well in my degree.
2. Give me a fantastic project to put on my CV.
3. Allow me to learn the ROS framework and POSE.


## Getting ROS2 setup

As a mac user installing anything graphically intensive is usually a pain and guess what? ROS2 is so hard to install on mac!!!!!! 

## My first approach: A Docker Container

Guess what? The desktop GUI image was not compiled for ARM64 so that didn't work as expected!

## Second Approach: Install naitively on mac

It worked!!! Just kidding I got RVIZ and Gazebo running but the tool to compile xacro files did not work! So I needed to find another solution

## Third Approach: Ubuntu Virtual Machine

Obviously this would work right? It does, **but** initially I had made a Ubuntu 22.04 install and well ROS2 no longer supports it so... I needed to make a 24.02 install which meant I **finally** was able to install everything on my mac!

## Up and Running: Now What?

Time to start the SLAM
